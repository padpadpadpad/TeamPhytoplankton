\title{Fitting a photosynthesis-irradiance curve}
\usage{
Platt_PI(I, ps, alpha, beta)
}
\arguments{
\item{I}{The value of light, either a vector or a single, numeric value.}

\item{ps}{Scaling coefficient for the curve}

\item{alpha}{The steepness of the initial gradient of the curve - is a
measure of photosynthetic efficiency}

\item{beta}{The steepness and extent of photoinhibition as light levels
increase past the optimum}
}
\value{
%% ~Describe the value returned %% If it is a LIST, use %%
}
\description{
Uses the Platt PI model with photoinhibition (Platt 1990) to fit a model to
photosynthesis data across many light levels typically taken using the
Oxylab system
}
\details{
When using nlsLoop, set the parameters lower limits to 0 as the equation has
two solutions and with equivalent AIC scores so could return some unwanted
negative values for some parameters.
