\title{
Fitting a photosynthesis-irradiance curve
}
\description{
Uses the Platt PI model with photoinhibition (Platt 1990) to fit a model to photosynthesis data across many light levels typically taken using the Oxylab system
}
\usage{
Platt_PI(I, ps, alpha, beta)
}
%- maybe also 'usage' for other objects documented here.
\arguments{
  \item{I}{
The value of light, either a vector or a single, numeric value.
}
  \item{ps}{
Scaling coefficient for the curve
}
  \item{alpha}{
The steepness of the initial gradient of the curve - is a measure of photosynthetic efficiency
}
  \item{beta}{
The steepness and extent of photoinhibition as light levels increase past the optimum
}
}
\details{
When using nlsLoop, set the parameters lower limits to 0 as the equation has two solutions and with equivalent AIC scores so could return some unwanted negative values for some parameters.
