\title{
Fitting a photosynthesis-irradiance curve
}
\description{
Uses the Platt PI model with photoinhibition (Platt 1990) to fit a model to photosynthesis data across many light levels typically taken using the Oxylab system
}
\usage{
Platt_PI(I, ps, alpha, beta)
}
%- maybe also 'usage' for other objects documented here.
\arguments{
  \item{I}{
The value of light, either a vector or a single, numeric value.
}
  \item{ps}{
Scaling coefficient for the curve
}
  \item{alpha}{
The steepness of the initial gradient of the curve - is a measure of photosynthetic efficiency
}
  \item{beta}{
The steepness and extent of photoinhibition as light levels increase past the optimum
}

## The function is currently defined as
function (I, ps, alpha, beta) 
{
    pi <- ps * (1 - exp(-alpha * I/ps)) * exp((-beta * I)/ps)
    return(pi)
