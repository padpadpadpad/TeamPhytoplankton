\title{Performs the modified Sharpe-Schoolfield equation on thermal response data
including both high and low temperature inactivation}
\usage{
schoolfield(ln.c, Ea, El, Tl, Eh, Th, temp, Tc)
}
\arguments{
\item{ln.c}{The specific rate of metabolism (log scale)}

\item{Ea}{Activation energy}

\item{El}{Low temperature deactivation energy}

\item{Tl}{Temperature at which enzyme is 1/2 active and 1/2 low temperature
suppressed}

\item{Eh}{High temperature deactivation energy}

\item{Th}{Temperature at which enzyme is 1/2 active and 1/2 high temperature
suppressed}

\item{temp}{Temperature in K}

\item{Tc}{Standardisation temperature (in ºC, arbitrary)}
}
\value{
Returns a value of metabolism b(T) across the range of temperatures
set based on the parameter values
}
\description{
Models the thermal performance curve for metabolism using a modified thermal
performance curve which includes inactivation of the rate at both low and
high temperatures.
