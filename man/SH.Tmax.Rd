\title{Empirically calculates the maximum temperature of a schoolfield.high model
fit}
\usage{
SH.Tmax(data, prop, Tc, K = "Y", bTopt, id.col, range)
}
\arguments{
\item{data}{The parameter data frame}

\item{prop}{The proportion below bTpeak from which the thermal minima is to
be calculated}

\item{Tc}{The normalising temperature used in the original schoolfield.high
fits}

\item{K}{Whether or not Topt is in Kelvin. Defaults to 'Y'. To override
default use 'N'.}

\item{bTopt}{Name of the column for optimal rate.}

\item{id.col}{The column that identifies each curve. Is equivalent to the
id.col from nlsLoop.}

\item{range}{The range of temperatures from which you want the Kelvin to be
taken, is centred around the optimal temperature. For range = 500 and Topt =
30, the temperatures would be from 30 - 250 and 30 + 250.}

}
\description{
Creates a temporary dataframe of a wide range of temperatures (at 0.1 degree
increments) and predictions based on the parameters controlling the thermal
response curve. The thermal maximia is the first temperature where the rate
is less than the threshold proportion of bTpeak above Topt.
