\title{Performs the modified Sharpe-Schoolfield equation for high temperature
inactivation}
\usage{
schoolfield.high(ln.c, Ea, Eh, Th, temp, Tc)

\arguments{
\item{ln.c}{The specific rate of metabolism (log scale)}

\item{Ea}{Activation energy}

\item{Eh}{High temperare De-Activation energy}

\item{Th}{T at which enzyme is 1/2 active and 1/2 High-T suppressed}

\item{temp}{temperature in K}

\item{Tc}{standardisation temperature (in ÂºC, arbitrary)}
