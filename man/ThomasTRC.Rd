\title{Fits a thermal performance curve to data using the formula given by Thomas
et al. 2012.}
\usage{
ThomasTRC(a, Topt, w, temp)
}
\arguments{
\item{a}{scaling parameter for the curve.}

\item{Topt}{controls the position of where the quadratic portion reaches its
maximum. So in essence z is the Topt.}

\item{w}{the breadth of thermal performance curve, the range over which the
dependent variable is postive}

\item{temp}{temperature, can be in degrees centigrade or Kelvin}
}
\value{
returns the biological rate at a given temperature depending on the
parameters controlling the model.
}
\description{
Fits a thermal performance curve to data such as the following equation :
}
\details{
g(T) = a*[1 - ((Topt-T)/(w/2))^2]

where a is a scaling coefficient, Topt is the optimum temperature and w is
the range of temperatures over which the rate is positive.

Tmin and Tmax can be calculated by subtracting or adding w/2 to Topt
respectively. See \code{\link{Thomas.Tmax}} and \code{\link{Thomas.Tmin}}.

Rates need to be in raw form not logged as its important that negative rates
are actually negative rates to be able to correctly calculate w
