\title{
Fits a thermal performance curve to data using the formula given by Thomas et al. 2012.
}
\description{
Fits a thermal performance curve to data such as the following equation :

g(T) = a*[1 - ((Topt-T)/(w/2))^2]

where a is a scaling coefficient, Topt is the optimum temperature and w is the range of temperatures over which the rate is positive. 

Tmin and Tmax can be calculated by subtracting or adding w/2 to Topt respectively. See \code{\link{Thomas.Tmax}} and \code{\link{Thomas.Tmin}}.
}
\usage{
ThomasTRC(a, Topt, w, temp)
}
%- maybe also 'usage' for other objects documented here.
\arguments{
  \item{a}{
scaling parameter for the curve.
}
  \item{Topt}{
controls the position of where the quadratic portion reaches its maximum. So in essence z is the Topt.
}
  \item{w}{
the breadth of thermal performance curve, the range over which the dependent variable is postive
}
  \item{temp}{
temperature, can be in degrees centigrade or Kelvin
}
}
\details{
Rates need to be in raw form not logged as its important that negative rates are actually negative rates to be able to correctly calculate w
}
\value{
returns the biological rate at a given temperature depending on the parameters controlling the model.
