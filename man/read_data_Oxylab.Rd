\title{Binds desired O2 view files together}
\usage{
read_data_Oxylab(file.list, start.time)
}
\arguments{
\item{file.list}{A list of O2 view files}

\item{start.time}{The row at which you want data to be collected from}
}
\value{
a dataframe of the combined Oxylab files with a column identifying each file
}
\description{
Takes a list of files and binds them together at the desired number of
seconds. If you have a load of files all starting at the same number of
seconds (eg first light on at 180 seconds) the code will cut all the data at
that point.
}
\details{
O2 view files unfortunately do not have continuous values in the Light
column. Instead only the changes in light are recorded. This function
completes the light column by taking the last value in the column and
filling all the rows until the next value.

After running the code you are left with a four column data frame (O2, time,
light, identifier)

identifier - the identifier is the name of each file without the extension
added. So I cannot stress the importance of having logical names for each
file!
}
\examples{

Used with ldply, it takes each value of the list and does the function on that data, before combining it all into a single dataframe.

compiled.data <- ldply(list.of.my.files, read_data_Oxylab, start.time = 120)
