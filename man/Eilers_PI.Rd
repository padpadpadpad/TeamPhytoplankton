\title{
Fitting a photosynthesis-irradiance curve
}
\description{
Uses the Eilers & Peeters (1988) PI model to fit a model to photosynthesis data across many light levels typically taken using the Oxylab system. Benefits from modelling Pmax without any other derivatives so can test the probability of the parameter.
}
\usage{
Eilers_PI(Pmax, Iopt, a, I)
}
%- maybe also 'usage' for other objects documented here.
\arguments{
  \item{Pmax}{
The photosynthetic maxima
}
  \item{Iopt}{
The optimal light intensity
}
  \item{a}{
The initial slope of the curve
}
  \item{I}{
Light
}
}
\details{
When using nlsLoop, set the parameters lower limits to 0 as the equation has two solutions and with equivalent AIC scores so could return some unwanted negative values for some parameters.
