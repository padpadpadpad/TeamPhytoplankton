\title{Fitting a photosynthesis-irradiance curve}
\usage{
Eilers_PI(Pmax, Iopt, a, I)
}
\arguments{
\item{Pmax}{The photosynthetic maxima}

\item{Iopt}{The optimal light intensity}

\item{a}{The initial slope of the curve}

\item{I}{Light}
}
\description{
Uses the Eilers & Peeters (1988) PI model to fit a model to photosynthesis
data across many light levels typically taken using the Oxylab system.
Benefits from modelling Pmax without any other derivatives so can test the
probability of the parameter.
}
\details{
When using nlsLoop, set the parameters lower limits to 0 as the equation has
two solutions and with equivalent AIC scores so could return some unwanted
negative values for some parameters.
